# Ecommerce API Project

## Overview

This project is an E-commerce API developed using Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL. It is designed to provide a backend solution for e-commerce platforms, offering a range of features from product management to order processing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- MySQL

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary packages using npm:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up your MySQL database and ensure it is running.
4. Configure the database settings in the `config` directory.

### Running the Application
1. Start the server:
   ```
   node server.js
   ```
2. The API will be available at `http://localhost:[PORT]`, where `[PORT]` is the port number specified in the server configuration.

## Project Structure
- `config`: Contains configuration settings for the application, such as database configuration.
- `controllers`: Holds the logic for handling requests and sending responses. Each controller typically corresponds to a specific functionality of the API.
- `helpers`: Provides utility functions that support various operations within the application.
- `middlewares`: Includes middleware functions for handling requests, such as authentication and error handling.
- `models`: Contains data models representing the structure of the database tables and potentially methods for querying or manipulating data.
- `routers`: Defines the routes for the API. Each route is linked to its corresponding controller.
- `server.js`: The main entry point for the application. It initializes the Express server and sets up middleware and routes.

## Features
- **Product Management**: Create, read, update, and delete products.
- **Order Processing**: Handle customer orders and track order status.
- **User Authentication**: Register and authenticate users.
